# Modifying-kernel-for-faster-booting

In this project, the primary focus lies in the development of a custom Linux kernel, tailored to specific hardware requirements and performance optimizations. The objectives encompass optimizing system performance, tailoring feature sets, ensuring hardware compatibility, fostering educational understanding, and documenting the customization process for reproducibility. By meticulously configuring kernel options, users can delve deep into the inner workings of the Linux kernel, enhancing their understanding of operating system concepts. 

The implementation involves obtaining the Linux kernel source code, installing necessary packages, and customizing the kernel through a meticulous exploration of configuration options. Key customization areas include general setup, processor types and features, device drivers, and error resolution. Through detailed documentation, the project provides step-by-step guidance on kernel customization, including resolving encountered errors and updating the GRUB bootloader. Furthermore, applications of the customized kernel extend to various domains, including embedded systems, security enhancements, real-time systems, education, research, and experimentation.
